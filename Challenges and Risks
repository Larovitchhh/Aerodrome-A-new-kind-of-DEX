While innovative, Aerodrome faces challenges:Single-Chain Dependency: Operates solely on Base, limiting diversification compared to multi-chain DEXs.

Inflationary Token Model: AERO’s weekly emissions may dilute value if demand doesn’t keep pace.

Impermanent Loss: LPs face risks typical of AMMs, especially in volatile pools.

Governance Attacks: The ve model could be vulnerable to large holders manipulating votes, though long-term locking mitigates this.

High Gas Fees: While Base is cheaper than Ethereum mainnet, smaller transactions can still be costly until Layer 2 scalability improves
