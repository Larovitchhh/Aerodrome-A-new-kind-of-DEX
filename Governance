The AERO token is central to Aerodromeâ€™s ecosystem, serving as both a utility and governance token. Holders can lock AERO for 1 week to 4 years to receive veAERO NFTs, with voting power scaling linearly with lock duration. veAERO holders vote weekly to allocate AERO emissions to pools, influencing liquidity distribution. This model aligns incentives, as long-term lockers gain more influence and rewards.
