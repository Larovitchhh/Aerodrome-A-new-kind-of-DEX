Aerodrome operates as an AMM, allowing users to swap tokens directly from their wallets against liquidity pools without intermediaries. Traders select from over 180 supported assets, paying a small fee (0.02%) per swap, which is redistributed to veAERO holders rather than LPs. This ensures low slippage and competitive pricing, even for volatile or stable token pairs
