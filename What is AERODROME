Aerodrome Finance is a decentralized exchange built on the Base network, leveraging the Velodrome V2 protocol stack to deliver advanced AMM functionality. Unlike traditional DEXs like Uniswap, where liquidity providers (LPs) primarily earn trading fees, Aerodrome introduces a novel reward mechanism powered by its native AERO token and a vote-escrow (ve) model inspired by Curve and Convex. It serves as the central liquidity hub for Base, facilitating efficient token swaps with minimal slippage and offering customizable liquidity pools.
